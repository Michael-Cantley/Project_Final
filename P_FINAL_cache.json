One roll from a trooper, and he is so far away, you cannot reach him, because he shoots you down in that short amount of time.   It takes like 6 or more staff strikes to kill someone, using the Horn makes little difference, it gives away your position more than it gives you a buff.  Survival instinct is broken, I don't understand how it's supposed to work. Sometimes it gives me wallhack, sometimes it doesn't give anything, not even the footprint tracking.  In game (green) party outlines still show when you are on opposing teams.  That fairy grenade is the most no skill ability since Rey's Mind Trick. It is not clear that it works like an incendiary grenade, so it has a fix AoE, once you leave that, the fairies leave you alone. However while inside, you have no defense against them, rolling doesn't help, and the fact that Ewok attacks are worthless as stated above, the only thing they can do is spam the fairies, to annoy the troopers.   It seems like a fun tactic for the entire imperial team to camp inside the cave, however two ewoks have no chance of killing anyone in there, doesn't matter how many flanks the cave has. After many matches the imps always end up camping in the cave. The only time we leave is when we are so OP, we don't need to camp against the Ewoks.  The heavy gun has infinite flashlight. I don't think this is intended, but then again Iden's emotes aren't working since day 1, so who knows.

Suggestions:  - make Ewok attacks stronger, 2 hit kill with battle cry, 4 without, and 3 with fairy damage combined.  - it is Ewok home territory, make them faster, jump better so they can navigate terrain better. Ewoks should be able to climb rocks the Imps can't, however as of right now it's the opposite.  - encourage imperials to be on the move, and not camp inside the cave (don't punish, encourage, eg: get bonus credits for passing random checkpoints around the map or collecting remnant tech from the Endor garrison)   bonus score won't do, Level 50 player don't get score anyway, but credits are very valuable now ", 2, "alexaka1", "dxla14a", "2018-04-18 21:21:37", "21", 1], ["Please consider requests to \"Make this permanent\" a sign of too soon to tell, but very positive feedback that the team made a fun mode!!!

Totally nailed the almost horror-esque feeling of being hunted as troopers, and the predatory feeling of playing an ewok is awesome.  * Caves should have another entrance from above, once troopers realize it is there usually it only takes one person covering it to keep the ewoks out.  * Pickups should be random. The rush to grab them at the start is reminiscent of the pickups of swbf 2015, and we all know how the community feels about those... * The pickup themselves is great, love the improved flashlight and weapon, the grenade is awesome too.  * Its tough to land the aerial attack as an ewok, seems like the hitbox is really tiny? Or maybe I just need practice. Some sort of glider would be amazing.  * There should be some counterplay to the lights in the cave system. it would be nice as an ewok is the wisties could put out torches, or something. Maybe give the ewoks a water balloon type pouch thing, that functions as a pickup in the swampy area and puts out torches when tossed at them. Can you imagine the fear in the heart of a stormtrooper as he watches the torches around him go out, one by one?  * It would be nice if there was a delay between when the ramp lowers on the ship and when troopers can board. Every game I've played where the the troopers have survived until the end, they are able to board immediately after landing with barely any ewoks being able to arrive in time to even attempt to stop them.  * A timer, similar to the galactic assault timeline at the top of the screen that shows progress, would be nice to show the arrival of the ship.

One roll from a trooper, and he is so far away, you cannot reach him, because he shoots you down in that short amount of time.   It takes like 6 or more staff strikes to kill someone, using the Horn makes little difference, it gives away your position more than it gives you a buff.  Survival instinct is broken, I don't understand how it's supposed to work. Sometimes it gives me wallhack, sometimes it doesn't give anything, not even the footprint tracking.  In game (green) party outlines still show when you are on opposing teams.  That fairy grenade is the most no skill ability since Rey's Mind Trick. It is not clear that it works like an incendiary grenade, so it has a fix AoE, once you leave that, the fairies leave you alone. However while inside, you have no defense against them, rolling doesn't help, and the fact that Ewok attacks are worthless as stated above, the only thing they can do is spam the fairies, to annoy the troopers.   It seems like a fun tactic for the entire imperial team to camp inside the cave, however two ewoks have no chance of killing anyone in there, doesn't matter how many flanks the cave has. After many matches the imps always end up camping in the cave. The only time we leave is when we are so OP, we don't need to camp against the Ewoks.  The heavy gun has infinite flashlight. I don't think this is intended, but then again Iden's emotes aren't working since day 1, so who knows.

Suggestions:  - make Ewok attacks stronger, 2 hit kill with battle cry, 4 without, and 3 with fairy damage combined.  - it is Ewok home territory, make them faster, jump better so they can navigate terrain better. Ewoks should be able to climb rocks the Imps can't, however as of right now it's the opposite.  - encourage imperials to be on the move, and not camp inside the cave (don't punish, encourage, eg: get bonus credits for passing random checkpoints around the map or collecting remnant tech from the Endor garrison)   bonus score won't do, Level 50 player don't get score anyway, but credits are very valuable now ", 2, "alexaka1", "dxla14a", "2018-04-18 21:21:37", "21", 1], ["Please consider requests to \"Make this permanent\" a sign of too soon to tell, but very positive feedback that the team made a fun mode!!!

Totally nailed the almost horror-esque feeling of being hunted as troopers, and the predatory feeling of playing an ewok is awesome.  * Caves should have another entrance from above, once troopers realize it is there usually it only takes one person covering it to keep the ewoks out.  * Pickups should be random. The rush to grab them at the start is reminiscent of the pickups of swbf 2015, and we all know how the community feels about those... * The pickup themselves is great, love the improved flashlight and weapon, the grenade is awesome too.  * Its tough to land the aerial attack as an ewok, seems like the hitbox is really tiny? Or maybe I just need practice. Some sort of glider would be amazing.  * There should be some counterplay to the lights in the cave system. it would be nice as an ewok is the wisties could put out torches, or something. Maybe give the ewoks a water balloon type pouch thing, that functions as a pickup in the swampy area and puts out torches when tossed at them. Can you imagine the fear in the heart of a stormtrooper as he watches the torches around him go out, one by one?  * It would be nice if there was a delay between when the ramp lowers on the ship and when troopers can board. Every game I've played where the the troopers have survived until the end, they are able to board immediately after landing with barely any ewoks being able to arrive in time to even attempt to stop them.  * A timer, similar to the galactic assault timeline at the top of the screen that shows progress, would be nice to show the arrival of the ship.

Now imagine that eventually we have an Ewok Hunt, Wampa Hunt, Rancor survival, and several other specialty modes that run for a week or two then turn off then in another week or two we get a fresh mode again. this rotation would always have something new and refreshing for us to try.   I hope the devs consider this option. I'd hate for Ewok Hunt to get boring after awhile and then abandoned when it's really a cool mode..   Edit: In addition to this, DICE might want to explore adding a mini battle royale mode to Battlefront. It would make for a pretty cool event.

So E.A. and Dice, in their in-game currency is giving you, as a player the equivalent of a salary of $1 dollar per hour for your time played\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 this means that it is impossible under normal game play to unlock everything and forces you the player to pay more money then a season pass or a full price $60.00 dollar retail game or for that matter even more then both combined (and this is not taking into account the original purchase price of the game) if you want to access all of the games content.  How is that right? This effectively makes the game cost more then any other star wars title\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and keep in mind, we still don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have other character or clone skins which will cost us how much more play time or money?

B) 480,000 credits to unlock all of the newly added class alternate heads (again, many are from the previous game)... these total 39 but you re-buy some, if you want to use them in another era (also limited to a specific class).  C)No clone or empire skins included and not including future heroes, classes or vehicles\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 which they have stated you will have to unlock or pay for...  D)Not including the 5 heroes skins mentioned in A, you would need to spend an additional $176.25 (again if buying the top value crystal pack) to unlock everything recently added or play the game for more then 176 hours based on the above average game play listed above (about 4k per hour)\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 or in my case based my average (listed above) more then 400.

For instance, in Endor during phase I, the middle objective (underground bunker).  As the Rebels (or Empire...can't remember) it's generally tough getting down the stairs on the left. So as an Officer I will drop down and place a shield at the bottom.  Every time I have done this my team pushes up and moves the choke point from the top of those stairs to the bottom. From there, if I make it up to the objective I will drop a shield for myself or someone else.  You just have to be selective with it and think twice about how it helps your team.  Another good one is Crait phase 2 as the FO. Any objective that requires you to be in a certain area for the counter to go up is usually a good spot for the shield.

Survival instinct is broken, I don't understand how it's supposed to work. Sometimes it gives me wallhack, sometimes it doesn't give anything, not even the footprint tracking.

However while inside, you have no defense against them, rolling doesn't help, and the fact that Ewok attacks are worthless as stated above, the only thing they can do is spam the fairies, to annoy the troopers.   It seems like a fun tactic for the entire imperial team to camp inside the cave, however two ewoks have no chance of killing anyone in there, doesn't matter how many flanks the cave has.

Totally nailed the almost horror-esque feeling of being hunted as troopers, and the predatory feeling of playing an ewok is awesome.  * Caves should have another entrance from above, once troopers realize it is there usually it only takes one person covering it to keep the ewoks out.  * Pickups should be random. The rush to grab them at the start is reminiscent of the pickups of swbf 2015, and we all know how the community feels about those... * The pickup themselves is great, love the improved flashlight and weapon, the grenade is awesome too.  * Its tough to land the aerial attack as an ewok, seems like the hitbox is really tiny? Or maybe I just need practice. Some sort of glider would be amazing.  * There should be some counterplay to the lights in the cave system. it would be nice as an ewok is the wisties could put out torches, or something. Maybe give the ewoks a water balloon type pouch thing, that functions as a pickup in the swampy area and puts out torches when tossed at them. Can you imagine the fear in the heart of a stormtrooper as he watches the torches around him go out, one by one?  * It would be nice if there was a delay between when the ramp lowers on the ship and when troopers can board. Every game I've played where the the troopers have survived until the end, they are able to board immediately after landing with barely any ewoks being able to arrive in time to even attempt to stop them.  * A timer, similar to the galactic assault timeline at the top of the screen that shows progress, would be nice to show the arrival of the ship.

Though when you're playing as the Ewoks, the moment you see that the shuttle is incoming. That's basically the end of the game. You don't physically have enough time to haul ass to the evac point before it touches down to set up an ambush or even do a suicide charge to get one last hit in. I feel like it would work a little better if the troopers were told at the five minute mark where the evac WILL be, and should start making their way there.

One roll from a trooper, and he is so far away, you cannot reach him, because he shoots you down in that short amount of time.   It takes like 6 or more staff strikes to kill someone, using the Horn makes little difference, it gives away your position more than it gives you a buff.  Survival instinct is broken, I don't understand how it's supposed to work. Sometimes it gives me wallhack, sometimes it doesn't give anything, not even the footprint tracking.  In game (green) party outlines still show when you are on opposing teams.  That fairy grenade is the most no skill ability since Rey's Mind Trick. It is not clear that it works like an incendiary grenade, so it has a fix AoE, once you leave that, the fairies leave you alone. However while inside, you have no defense against them, rolling doesn't help, and the fact that Ewok attacks are worthless as stated above, the only thing they can do is spam the fairies, to annoy the troopers.   It seems like a fun tactic for the entire imperial team to camp inside the cave, however two ewoks have no chance of killing anyone in there, doesn't matter how many flanks the cave has. After many matches the imps always end up camping in the cave. The only time we leave is when we are so OP, we don't need to camp against the Ewoks.  The heavy gun has infinite flashlight. I don't think this is intended, but then again Iden's emotes aren't working since day 1, so who knows. I'm okay with it having double, or even triple the battery than a normal gun, but having infinite battery makes the mechanic pointless for the starting weapon.   Suggestions:  - make Ewok attacks stronger, 2 hit kill with battle cry, 4 without, and 3 with fairy damage combined.  - it is Ewok home territory, make them faster, jump better so they can navigate terrain better. Ewoks should be able to climb rocks the Imps can't, however as of right now it's the opposite.  - encourage imperials to be on the move, and not camp inside the cave (don't punish, encourage, eg: get bonus credits for passing random checkpoints around the map or collecting remnant tech from the Endor garrison)   bonus score won't do, Level 50 player don't get score anyway, but credits are very valuable now ", 2, "alexaka1", "dxla14a", "2018-04-18 21:21:37", "21", 1], ["General feedback:  * The atmosphere is amazing. Totally nailed the almost horror-esque feeling of being hunted as troopers, and the predatory feeling of playing an ewok is awesome.  * Caves should have another entrance from above, once troopers realize it is there usually it only takes one person covering it to keep the ewoks out.  * Pickups should be random. The rush to grab them at the start is reminiscent of the pickups of swbf 2015, and we all know how the community feels about those... * The pickup themselves is great, love the improved flashlight and weapon, the grenade is awesome too.  * Its tough to land the aerial attack as an ewok, seems like the hitbox is really tiny? Or maybe I just need practice. Some sort of glider would be amazing.  * There should be some counterplay to the lights in the cave system. it would be nice as an ewok is the wisties could put out torches, or something. Maybe give the ewoks a water balloon type pouch thing, that functions as a pickup in the swampy area and puts out torches when tossed at them. Can you imagine the fear in the heart of a stormtrooper as he watches the torches around him go out, one by one?  * It would be nice if there was a delay between when the ramp lowers on the ship and when troopers can board. Every game I've played where the the troopers have survived until the end, they are able to board immediately after landing with barely any ewoks being able to arrive in time to even attempt to stop them.  * A timer, similar to the galactic assault timeline at the top of the screen that shows progress, would be nice to show the arrival of the ship.

As a huge SW fan, it was tough, and I continued to monitor the game regularly. To my surprise, rather than drop the game entirely after a rocky launch as EA normally does, the Battlefront team doubled down and redid the progression system. I started watching streams of the game when it was announced, and began my time in the new BF2 the day the progression went live.  Couldn't be happier with the game. Recommended it to everybody that will listen, especially those that, like me, stayed away before. It's probably approaching addiction levels at this point with the amount of hours I've logged, and the content drip has been nice and steady.

I rewatched the \u00e2\u0080\u009cDarkness on Umbara\u00e2\u0080\u009d arc on The Clone Wars and after seeing how darkness and traps were well implemented into Ewok Hunt this week, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come up with several reasons why an Umbaran map would be perfect for Galactic Assault. Here are some ideas that I have that would make this map really work  - First off, Darkness is a must. Maybe implement the same deal as Ewok Hunt, only Clones have limited visibility but more health, compared to Umbarians, who have great visibility, but less durability.  - During the Umbarian arc, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen several different traps. In the first episode, we saw a Sarlacc attack Hardcase and ended up killing an unknown Clone. Later in the episode they 501st entered a road that was filled with IEDs. In the last episode of the arc, Tup used a sarlacc to capture General Krell  -  MAKE THE CLONE UNIT THE 501ST!! This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that big a deal, but hey, why not? Make the enforcer class Clone trooper Fives, that would be a really cool detail. Or maybe make Captain Rex a hero  - The Umbarians were given a few vehicles, though most of them were a bit too OP, so maybe nerf them a bit. I guess give Droid vehicles to compensate for those that the Umbarians didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have, since in the show they atleast had the support of a Separatist fleet.  - The map layout itself would be great. Have the Umbarians as defenders, with the 501st trying to capture the airfield like they did in the show. This way we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll finally have a offensive Clone force to play as. There would be  lots of different terrain and foliage that would be very unique to what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re currently used to  Those are my thoughts for a possible Umbara Galactic Assault map.

There are other voice clips for other heroes as well, like Phasma saying \"FN-2187 spotted\", Yoda saying \"Bossk has arrived. His poisons, beware\", Finn saying \"Bad guy, red face and spikes... and a lightsaber, not good!\" and so on. It'd be a cool way to implement these voice clips into the comms in the top left corner of the screen.

For instance, in Endor during phase I, the middle objective (underground bunker).  As the Rebels (or Empire...can't remember) it's generally tough getting down the stairs on the left. So as an Officer I will drop down and place a shield at the bottom.  Every time I have done this my team pushes up and moves the choke point from the top of those stairs to the bottom. From there, if I make it up to the objective I will drop a shield for myself or someone else.  You just have to be selective with it and think twice about how it helps your team.  Another good one is Crait phase 2 as the FO. Any objective that requires you to be in a certain area for the counter to go up is usually a good spot for the shield.

I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t play any other games with this type of mechanic but when I compare it to games that have season passes and things like that I really have a tough time justifying the money/time it takes to get a single \u00e2\u0080\u0098epic\u00e2\u0080\u0099 skin, much less whatever these legendary skins will be.   Honestly, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d take a season pass again over this system. The $50 I spent on the EABF season pass was the most satisfying DLC purchase I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever made!

So E.A. and Dice, in their in-game currency is giving you, as a player the equivalent of a salary of $1 dollar per hour for your time played\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 this means that it is impossible under normal game play to unlock everything and forces you the player to pay more money then a season pass or a full price $60.00 dollar retail game or for that matter even more then both combined (and this is not taking into account the original purchase price of the game) if you want to access all of the games content.

B) 480,000 credits to unlock all of the newly added class alternate heads (again, many are from the previous game)... these total 39 but you re-buy some, if you want to use them in another era (also limited to a specific class).  C)No clone or empire skins included and not including future heroes, classes or vehicles\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 which they have stated you will have to unlock or pay for...  D)Not including the 5 heroes skins mentioned in A, you would need to spend an additional $176.25 (again if buying the top value crystal pack) to unlock everything recently added or play the game for more then 176 hours based on the above average game play listed above (about 4k per hour)\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 or in my case based my average (listed above) more then 400.

The 3rd dash is a godsend for ambushes and escapes, and the throw range patches up one of Maul's weaknesses.   None of Maul's damage boost cards for his choke and throw allow him to one shot infantry he otherwise couldn't (DICE needs to buff the #'s on those so there's a reason to take them), I picked saber throw range as my third card because it seems to have the most utility.   Maybe choke radius could be decent, but the thing about maul is that if you stay still you die, so choke should be your last resort to make an escape from a bad situation.

Using the A280 with the range mod makes it really effective at medium and long range, IMO it's the best non-specialist weapon at range in the game aside from maybe the officer's S5, but does much better than the S5 at short range. The CR2 melts reinforcements at close range, though it's not good for much else. Even the starting weapon is pretty good, being slightly better than the A280 at close range due to its overall slightly higher firing rate.   I personally prefer the A280, as I can take out enemies at range. The only thing that beats that weapon at range would be the specialist at very long range (which is a different play style completely). And for very short range, the Assault has Vanguard which is #1 overall at very short range. The A280 also seems to work a lot better than Heavy at those ranges (although admittedly heavy is the only class I haven't really played much, but their bolts seem to barely tickle me at range). Plus the assault is the only class with the Assault Training card which makes a huge difference when trying to beat multiple enemies at once. Add in Toughen Up and you've got a trooper even tankier than a heavy.   So at very short, medium, and long range the assault is the best. The officer is the best at short range with the Blurgg and decent at medium. The specialist is best at very long, close to the assault at long.   But I will concede that many people have the same issue you do with the assault in that they don't initially seem to shine at anything. I think it's just a matter of playstyle.
