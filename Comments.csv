"Cheers and Congratulations on the fantastic update! Yub hub!   Ewok Hunt- You guys did amazing on this! The idea is extremely unique and the immersion of being stranded in the forest is fantastic. The Ewoks are surprisingly good, they should replace the Wookies on GA (only for Endor). Hunt should definitely be a permanent mode on Battlefront 2 because it has so much potential not just on maps already in the game, but also for future maps.   Here are  some Hunt ideas for maps already in the game. https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/8c2hz0/future_of_hunt_mode/?st=JG59RRN1&sh=93e09176  Skins - The Hero skins are great. Canât  wait to see more of the iconic looks from the movies! DICE please reconsider gender/species locking for the trooper classes. I donât understand why is that a thing in Battlefront 2. You guys should aim for what you guys did on Battlefront 2015, which was great trooper customization. Also, the prices for skins were reasonable so I have no problem with that. Skins have great potential so donât be afraid to go all in (while staying canon of course). It feels great and refreshing seeing different skins in a match.   Overall this was an awesome update in my opinion. Canât wait to see more!   Thank you. ",1,NinjaShadow111,dxko8f8,2018-04-18 16:02:51,16,1

"While I appreciate we finally have customisation, I think it could do with some more variation using what's currently in the game.  1) Have the appearances universal between most factions. There are some races or heads I'd really like to use on Assault but they are locked for Heavy.  2) As well as being able to purchase skins directly, let us also unlock them through challenges.  3) Ewok Hunt is fun, and I'd very much like to see the same mode for other eras or maps, like Hoth. Wampas hunting Rebels.  I'm very mixed on Clone skins. I know people would love to play the 501st, but the skins do represent legions and it would be weird seeing a mix of them in one battle. So for now I'm not too fussed, but it would be nice if we could edit individual pieces on our classes like weapon holsters or camo pattern.",1,JuicerJames,dxkch2f,2018-04-18 12:53:59,12,0

Love Survivors of Endor btw.  Finally, put private lobbies in the game. Some of the most fun I had so far was surviving with just my friends and me alive. It was tense.

"I haven't played in a while, but I came back to play this. I wish there was more variety, as only one map over and over may get stale very quickly.    Hunt was my 2nd favorite gamemode in the original Battlefront II, behind Conquest of course... You know what? I think this actually superior to the original Hunt mode. The original Hunt was basically team deathmatch that kind of got repetitive after a while. This Hunt however, is more of an infection type gamemode, with added depth and I prefer it that way, and it keeps you on your toes when you're on the defending team.   I would have never expected to be afraid of goddamn EWOKS, (The sound design is absolutely incredible) but you succeeded in that, and I think this deserves to be a permanent gamemode.

"Ewoks sprinting forward are slower than an Imperial just walking backwards. One roll from a trooper, and he is so far away, you cannot reach him, because he shoots you down in that short amount of time.   It takes like 6 or more staff strikes to kill someone, using the Horn makes little difference, it gives away your position more than it gives you a buff.  Survival instinct is broken, I don't understand how it's supposed to work. Sometimes it gives me wallhack, sometimes it doesn't give anything, not even the footprint tracking.  In game (green) party outlines still show when you are on opposing teams.  That fairy grenade is the most no skill ability since Rey's Mind Trick. It is not clear that it works like an incendiary grenade, so it has a fix AoE, once you leave that, the fairies leave you alone. However while inside, you have no defense against them, rolling doesn't help, and the fact that Ewok attacks are worthless as stated above, the only thing they can do is spam the fairies, to annoy the troopers.   It seems like a fun tactic for the entire imperial team to camp inside the cave, however two ewoks have no chance of killing anyone in there, doesn't matter how many flanks the cave has. After many matches the imps always end up camping in the cave. The only time we leave is when we are so OP, we don't need to camp against the Ewoks.  The heavy gun has infinite flashlight. I don't think this is intended, but then again Iden's emotes aren't working since day 1, so who knows. I'm okay with it having double, or even triple the battery than a normal gun, but having infinite battery makes the mechanic pointless for the starting weapon.   Suggestions:  - make Ewok attacks stronger, 2 hit kill with battle cry, 4 without, and 3 with fairy damage combined.  - it is Ewok home territory, make them faster, jump better so they can navigate terrain better. Ewoks should be able to climb rocks the Imps can't, however as of right now it's the opposite.  - encourage imperials to be on the move, and not camp inside the cave (don't punish, encourage, eg: get bonus credits for passing random checkpoints around the map or collecting remnant tech from the Endor garrison)   bonus score won't do, Level 50 player don't get score anyway, but credits are very valuable now ",2,alexaka1,dxla14a,2018-04-18 21:21:37,21,1

"General feedback:  * The atmosphere is amazing. Totally nailed the almost horror-esque feeling of being hunted as troopers, and the predatory feeling of playing an ewok is awesome.  * Caves should have another entrance from above, once troopers realize it is there usually it only takes one person covering it to keep the ewoks out.  * Pickups should be random. The rush to grab them at the start is reminiscent of the pickups of swbf 2015, and we all know how the community feels about those... * The pickup themselves is great, love the improved flashlight and weapon, the grenade is awesome too.  * Its tough to land the aerial attack as an ewok, seems like the hitbox is really tiny? Or maybe I just need practice. Some sort of glider would be amazing.  * There should be some counterplay to the lights in the cave system. it would be nice as an ewok is the wisties could put out torches, or something. Maybe give the ewoks a water balloon type pouch thing, that functions as a pickup in the swampy area and puts out torches when tossed at them. Can you imagine the fear in the heart of a stormtrooper as he watches the torches around him go out, one by one?  * It would be nice if there was a delay between when the ramp lowers on the ship and when troopers can board. Every game I've played where the the troopers have survived until the end, they are able to board immediately after landing with barely any ewoks being able to arrive in time to even attempt to stop them.  * A timer, similar to the galactic assault timeline at the top of the screen that shows progress, would be nice to show the arrival of the ship.    That's all i can think of for now. Love the mode so far, can't wait to play with friends later tonight. ",2,menofthesea,dxlkvo2,2018-04-19 00:22:34,00,0

"imo the cave really needs to go, an easily accessible fully lit easily defendable position takes away everything fun about the game mode. It just becomes spread out and heal when you get hit by flies.  EDIT: EXTREMELY hard to coordinate as ewoks with no voice chat, also make the ewoks faster the stormtroopers can literally walk backwards and shoot you and there's nothing you can do about it. Would also make the ewoks take 3 shots to down instead of 2 and maybe make the spear do 5 more damage. Also if you really must leave the cave accessible, don't give the stormtroopers such a good line of sight to it, make it more angled so they can't just aim directly through the passage.",2,King_Abdul,dxku6gk,2018-04-18 17:28:19,17,1
"Love the mode. Brings back memories of playing infection on Halo.   This mode should be a permanent standalone mode called âhuntâ with variations on different maps like sand people hunting jawas, ewoks hunting troopers, clones hunting Jedi (order 66), first order hunting resistance (through crystal cave for example), etc..

"I love this mode. If I had any complaints at all it would be that the Ewoks are, over all, too weak, both in offence and defence and the ability to see more clearly doesn't offer enough of an advantage to make up for it,  and that it's near impossible to win as the Ewoks if the StormTroopers can manage to hold up in the caves early enough in the round, as there is simply to many to kill before the shuttle arrives.

Needs more then one hole in the roof. If the storm troopers get to the cave before you can pick 2-3 off then itâs impossible to win. Itâs way too easy for a competent group of storm troopers to defend the cave plus itâs way too bright in there.

If they're running, you can't catch them and if somehow you do the horn has run out and you get punched twice and die.  One last Ewok thing is the spears from above feel reallly difficult to actually land.

"Overall- fun, immersive. Love destructive trees and sound/lighting is great.   I think storm troopers need a reason to move. 2-3 objectives to complete throughout the timer. This will prevent them from sitting in one spot the whole time, caves especially. Something dynamic like 80% of ur surviving team needs to be around atat. This prevents it from being 1 player PTO, these are team objectives. Donât let Ewoks see what/where objectives are so they canât camp them, they only hunt.  Also an objective could have 2 locations at once, so send x troops here and y here. So team has to split up. This should greatly increase the o shit moments that stormtroopers fee.   Too many weapon upgrades for stormtroopers. Or if u keep this many, make them expire after a minute or two. Or donât give weapon upgrade flashlight and bomb. Give me some reason to use default, as is I first go find an upgrade every game because the upgrade is vastly better.   I think these 2 above are needed. These I donât think are needed, but would add to the creepiness- lightning/thunder with rain falling night variant makes sound harder to pick up and more awesome lighting effects and mist/fog dust (dark, but less dark than now to adjust for fog).

They could also make Tuscan raiders on Tatooine vs stormtroopers also I donât think itâs to much of a stretch that when searching for the R2 and C3PO some could have been attacked by raiders.    Another idea is the the episode of the clone wars on the moon of Pantora when the Talz attacked the clone and droid bases could go either way. *  Also Geonosis also from the clone wars the Geonosians and clones inside of a cave network the Geonosians could be the brain invaders or regular living ones.  They could do wampas and rebels Iâve seen that post a few times   Hunt is a very promising mode with a lot of content potential.

Obviously this would change the whole objective so just an idea. 4. Keep Ewoks as enforcers for Rebel Endor missions. (Iâm not sure theyâre good enough/cool enough to replace all enforcers for rebels in other maps) 5. Please make next Hunt in the prequel timeline because the community is very clearly underwhelmed with the prequel content so far and that was supposed to be the entire draw of this game in my opinion, clone wars era.

Primary attacks need to have a sweeping motion that has a chance to trip or knock over players, while the actual melee button needs be the spear stab.     I feel like the Vision of the Storm troopers is awful. I believe their helmets have a form of Night Vision. They should be able to see better.   But since this game type requires the map to be dark it also makes the fires look terrible and the lighting even worse.    An easy fix would be that the stormtroopers have escaped from the ewok camps while the Rebels are celebrating.   They are helmetless and have to search for equipment in order to escape. This would keep them from seeing each other on the minimap or from communicating from a distance.    Ewoks should be able to see each other on the map and rally together.

"I absolutely love it! The only thing I would really modify is how the evac works. When the troopers make a beeline for the shuttle, they know exactly where it's going to land before it does. So they can just run straight there, and what I noticed is that the moment the shuttle lands the whole team just arrived about 15 seconds prior. So the moment the evac arrives it's game over. Though when you're playing as the Ewoks, the moment you see that the shuttle is incoming. That's basically the end of the game. You don't physically have enough time to haul ass to the evac point before it touches down to set up an ambush or even do a suicide charge to get one last hit in. I feel like it would work a little better if the troopers were told at the five minute mark where the evac WILL be, and should start making their way there. That way it avoids the mad dash to the finish that the hunters tiny let's just can't keep up with. And the troopers need to make the tactical choice to go early, and be exposed. Or go late and risk missing extraction. ",2,FlpFlopFatality,dxlwal6,2018-04-19 03:37:56,03,0
"I played about 10 matches today.  The thing that sticks out to me most about this mode is the tone. It's straight up frightening. When I got into my first match, I was hit in the face with how dark it was. Then, I tried to switch to 3rd person, and about after 30 seconds of trying, realized that it wasn't an option. And that's damn genius. Because the darkness closes in on you, and you really have to spin around. When you hear those horns in the distance, you know they're coming for you.  I had a lot of fun and I'm definitely going to play more. I'd love to see hunt modes on different maps with different species (I know this has been said a lot already, but I thought I'd throw in my support for it too).

If the Stormtroopers all camp in there it's impossible for ewoks to kill them.

"Ought to make a full blown hunt mode out of this with several maps, objectives, and factions in rotation. Plenty of opportunities for new maps and playable groups. The factions and setting might just be my big issue with it. I'm not exactly a fan of fumbling in the dark pvp vs a bunch of Oddjobs.  Personally I loathe ""Night on Endor"" like I do most ground modes, at this point I'm just accepting I'm probably never going to get those two challenges done. That doesn't mean we should be losing game modes as temporary. If it's added it ought to stay period. Even if I hate it with a passion someone out there really likes it and it's already there now.

Problem on groups. Yesterday I played a match with my friend on ewok hunt. He lost in the forest and switched team. We were in the group. And while he activated his vision he said he can see me. Now I know they can see. I played ewoks that is oke but he said he can see me directly with green outside. So like normal modes. It seems wrong. Can be fun bec he wanted to hunt me lots of time. But it is a bit wrong for me. Wanted to inform.    Also we need hug emote. Few people wanted to give hug to me bec I said troopers we can be friends (I was the first ewok on that round and for the first time I was playing it. I was the one of the last survivors all the time to that round. And turned all and came first with 11k+ score) So they wanted to give me a hug. Tried to become friends on AT-AT but some of the troopers not happy with that of course.   Also I'd like to see which evok I killed.

"I like other posts referring to potential new options (tusken raiders, wamps, etc.); however, I think the Ewok's damage should be boosted.

"I might get downvoted for this opinion, but hear me out:  In some games, reoccuring or ""on again/off again"" events actually work to do many things such as prevent staleness, create anticipation, and basically add variety.   I play a few other games that have special events that last for a week to 10 days or so then get turned off. There's about 6 of these special event modes. Every month there's two events.   Imagine Ewok hunt always being available. Eventually, it would get stale and the mode would be more or less abandoned. Now imagine that eventually we have an Ewok Hunt, Wampa Hunt, Rancor survival, and several other specialty modes that run for a week or two then turn off then in another week or two we get a fresh mode again. this rotation would always have something new and refreshing for us to try.   I hope the devs consider this option. I'd hate for Ewok Hunt to get boring after awhile and then abandoned when it's really a cool mode..   Edit: In addition to this, DICE might want to explore adding a mini battle royale mode to Battlefront. It would make for a pretty cool event. ",3,Beulshite,dxmjmcz,2018-04-19 14:18:12,14,0

Reinforcements: this would seem cool visually but gamifying it to be balanced would likely be untenable. Especially considering the armor and Heros the Imperials can get. Rebels would be handicapping themselves if any of them chose to spawn as an Ewok because technologically they're just no match. And then the humanoid Rebels are down that many members of their team.
