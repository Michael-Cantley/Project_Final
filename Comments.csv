"Ewok Hunt is actually a pretty fun mode.  However, random internal scripted radio chatter among troopers would have added to the whole empire ""immersion"" factor.

"Cheers and Congratulations on the fantastic update! Yub hub!   Ewok Hunt- You guys did amazing on this! The idea is extremely unique and the immersion of being stranded in the forest is fantastic. The Ewoks are surprisingly good, they should replace the Wookies on GA (only for Endor). Hunt should definitely be a permanent mode on Battlefront 2 because it has so much potential not just on maps already in the game, but also for future maps.   Here are  some Hunt ideas for maps already in the game. https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/8c2hz0/future_of_hunt_mode/?st=JG59RRN1&sh=93e09176  Skins - The Hero skins are great. Canât  wait to see more of the iconic looks from the movies! DICE please reconsider gender/species locking for the trooper classes. I donât understand why is that a thing in Battlefront 2. You guys should aim for what you guys did on Battlefront 2015, which was great trooper customization. Also, the prices for skins were reasonable so I have no problem with that. Skins have great potential so donât be afraid to go all in (while staying canon of course). It feels great and refreshing seeing different skins in a match.   Overall this was an awesome update in my opinion. Canât wait to see more!   Thank you. ",1,NinjaShadow111,dxko8f8,2018-04-18 16:02:51,16,1

"While I appreciate we finally have customisation, I think it could do with some more variation using what's currently in the game.  1) Have the appearances universal between most factions. There are some races or heads I'd really like to use on Assault but they are locked for Heavy.  2) As well as being able to purchase skins directly, let us also unlock them through challenges.  3) Ewok Hunt is fun, and I'd very much like to see the same mode for other eras or maps, like Hoth. Wampas hunting Rebels.  I'm very mixed on Clone skins. I know people would love to play the 501st, but the skins do represent legions and it would be weird seeing a mix of them in one battle. So for now I'm not too fussed, but it would be nice if we could edit individual pieces on our classes like weapon holsters or camo pattern.",1,JuicerJames,dxkch2f,2018-04-18 12:53:59,12,0

Hunt was my 2nd favorite gamemode in the original Battlefront II, behind Conquest of course... You know what? I think this actually superior to the original Hunt mode. The original Hunt was basically team deathmatch that kind of got repetitive after a while. This Hunt however, is more of an infection type gamemode, with added depth and I prefer it that way, and it keeps you on your toes when you're on the defending team.   I would have never expected to be afraid of goddamn EWOKS, (The sound design is absolutely incredible) but you succeeded in that, and I think this deserves to be a permanent gamemode.

"Ewoks sprinting forward are slower than an Imperial just walking backwards. One roll from a trooper, and he is so far away, you cannot reach him, because he shoots you down in that short amount of time.   It takes like 6 or more staff strikes to kill someone, using the Horn makes little difference, it gives away your position more than it gives you a buff.  Survival instinct is broken, I don't understand how it's supposed to work. Sometimes it gives me wallhack, sometimes it doesn't give anything, not even the footprint tracking.  In game (green) party outlines still show when you are on opposing teams.  That fairy grenade is the most no skill ability since Rey's Mind Trick. It is not clear that it works like an incendiary grenade, so it has a fix AoE, once you leave that, the fairies leave you alone. However while inside, you have no defense against them, rolling doesn't help, and the fact that Ewok attacks are worthless as stated above, the only thing they can do is spam the fairies, to annoy the troopers.   It seems like a fun tactic for the entire imperial team to camp inside the cave, however two ewoks have no chance of killing anyone in there, doesn't matter how many flanks the cave has. After many matches the imps always end up camping in the cave. The only time we leave is when we are so OP, we don't need to camp against the Ewoks.  The heavy gun has infinite flashlight. I don't think this is intended, but then again Iden's emotes aren't working since day 1, so who knows. I'm okay with it having double, or even triple the battery than a normal gun, but having infinite battery makes the mechanic pointless for the starting weapon.   Suggestions:  - make Ewok attacks stronger, 2 hit kill with battle cry, 4 without, and 3 with fairy damage combined.  - it is Ewok home territory, make them faster, jump better so they can navigate terrain better. Ewoks should be able to climb rocks the Imps can't, however as of right now it's the opposite.  - encourage imperials to be on the move, and not camp inside the cave (don't punish, encourage, eg: get bonus credits for passing random checkpoints around the map or collecting remnant tech from the Endor garrison)   bonus score won't do, Level 50 player don't get score anyway, but credits are very valuable now ",2,alexaka1,dxla14a,2018-04-18 21:21:37,21,1

"General feedback:  * The atmosphere is amazing. Totally nailed the almost horror-esque feeling of being hunted as troopers, and the predatory feeling of playing an ewok is awesome.  * Caves should have another entrance from above, once troopers realize it is there usually it only takes one person covering it to keep the ewoks out.  * Pickups should be random. The rush to grab them at the start is reminiscent of the pickups of swbf 2015, and we all know how the community feels about those... * The pickup themselves is great, love the improved flashlight and weapon, the grenade is awesome too.  * Its tough to land the aerial attack as an ewok, seems like the hitbox is really tiny? Or maybe I just need practice. Some sort of glider would be amazing.  * There should be some counterplay to the lights in the cave system. it would be nice as an ewok is the wisties could put out torches, or something. Maybe give the ewoks a water balloon type pouch thing, that functions as a pickup in the swampy area and puts out torches when tossed at them. Can you imagine the fear in the heart of a stormtrooper as he watches the torches around him go out, one by one?  * It would be nice if there was a delay between when the ramp lowers on the ship and when troopers can board. Every game I've played where the the troopers have survived until the end, they are able to board immediately after landing with barely any ewoks being able to arrive in time to even attempt to stop them.  * A timer, similar to the galactic assault timeline at the top of the screen that shows progress, would be nice to show the arrival of the ship.    That's all i can think of for now. Love the mode so far, can't wait to play with friends later tonight. ",2,menofthesea,dxlkvo2,2018-04-19 00:22:34,00,0

A few of the games I've played the storm troopers have one even though the transport is covered in ewoks and the troopers are nowhere close. They should have to be near the transport far a short while to win, similar to capturing a location of GA. *Maybe make the storm troopers able to destroy the platforms with blasters.

It just becomes spread out and heal when you get hit by flies.

Would also make the ewoks take 3 shots to down instead of 2 and maybe make the spear do 5 more damage. Also if you really must leave the cave accessible, don't give the stormtroopers such a good line of sight to it, make it more angled so they can't just aim directly through the passage.",2,King_Abdul,dxku6gk,2018-04-18 17:28:19,17,1

Needs more then one hole in the roof. If the storm troopers get to the cave before you can pick 2-3 off then itâs impossible to win.

I think Ewoks need a better way to communicate. Troopers are able to work together much more effectively because of all the ways they can communicate with each other. Lights. Blasters. Emotes.

It would make the Stormtroopers think twice about their lights of the ewoks saw things a little darker (not totally dark like the troopers though). It would also encourage use of hunters instinct.  The 25 eliminations challenge is a bit silly for the game mode in my opinion. You may go a few games before getting a single kill, especially if you never start as the ewok. I would prefer something more like ""Extract as a trooper 5 times"" or ""survive for 30 minutes as a trooper"" or anything more thematic to the mode than just simple eliminations.

If they're running, you can't catch them and if somehow you do the horn has run out and you get punched twice and die.  One last Ewok thing is the spears from above feel reallly difficult to actually land.

Smaller problems:   - ewoks can not overtake running troopers which is a problem since they don't have ranged weapons  - all troopers are just camping in the caves  - it takes 5-6 hits for an ewok to kill a trooper from behind - it's too many; the game should reward you if you can flank an enemy as an ewok ",2,iluvatartheone,dxkha8n,2018-04-18 14:19:27,14,1

"Overall- fun, immersive. Love destructive trees and sound/lighting is great.   I think storm troopers need a reason to move. 2-3 objectives to complete throughout the timer. This will prevent them from sitting in one spot the whole time, caves especially. Something dynamic like 80% of ur surviving team needs to be around atat. This prevents it from being 1 player PTO, these are team objectives. Donât let Ewoks see what/where objectives are so they canât camp them, they only hunt.  Also an objective could have 2 locations at once, so send x troops here and y here. So team has to split up. This should greatly increase the o shit moments that stormtroopers fee.   Too many weapon upgrades for stormtroopers. Or if u keep this many, make them expire after a minute or two. Or donât give weapon upgrade flashlight and bomb. Give me some reason to use default, as is I first go find an upgrade every game because the upgrade is vastly better.   I think these 2 above are needed. These I donât think are needed, but would add to the creepiness- lightning/thunder with rain falling night variant makes sound harder to pick up and more awesome lighting effects and mist/fog dust (dark, but less dark than now to adjust for fog).

They could also make Tuscan raiders on Tatooine vs stormtroopers also I donât think itâs to much of a stretch that when searching for the R2 and C3PO some could have been attacked by raiders.    Another idea is the the episode of the clone wars on the moon of Pantora when the Talz attacked the clone and droid bases could go either way. *  Also Geonosis also from the clone wars the Geonosians and clones inside of a cave network the Geonosians could be the brain invaders or regular living ones.  They could do wampas and rebels Iâve seen that post a few times   Hunt is a very promising mode with a lot of content potential.

Please make next Hunt in the prequel timeline because the community is very clearly underwhelmed with the prequel content so far and that was supposed to be the entire draw of this game in my opinion, clone wars era.

It's simple, unique, effective, atmospheric, and lore-friendly  I love the game, but more and more I've realized the other modes feel a lot more 'Arcadey' to me. Great fast-paced gameplay, but less emphasis on the authenticity/atmosphere (cross-era heroes being a decent example)   I've been missing the more 'authenticity-focused' previous Battlefront, but imho this mode is a big step in the right direction.

"I absolutely love it! The only thing I would really modify is how the evac works. When the troopers make a beeline for the shuttle, they know exactly where it's going to land before it does. So they can just run straight there, and what I noticed is that the moment the shuttle lands the whole team just arrived about 15 seconds prior. So the moment the evac arrives it's game over. Though when you're playing as the Ewoks, the moment you see that the shuttle is incoming. That's basically the end of the game. You don't physically have enough time to haul ass to the evac point before it touches down to set up an ambush or even do a suicide charge to get one last hit in. I feel like it would work a little better if the troopers were told at the five minute mark where the evac WILL be, and should start making their way there. That way it avoids the mad dash to the finish that the hunters tiny let's just can't keep up with. And the troopers need to make the tactical choice to go early, and be exposed. Or go late and risk missing extraction. ",2,FlpFlopFatality,dxlwal6,2018-04-19 03:37:56,03,0
"I played about 10 matches today.  The thing that sticks out to me most about this mode is the tone. It's straight up frightening. When I got into my first match, I was hit in the face with how dark it was. Then, I tried to switch to 3rd person, and about after 30 seconds of trying, realized that it wasn't an option. And that's damn genius. Because the darkness closes in on you, and you really have to spin around. When you hear those horns in the distance, you know they're coming for you.  I had a lot of fun and I'm definitely going to play more. I'd love to see hunt modes on different maps with different species (I know this has been said a lot already, but I thought I'd throw in my support for it too).

"Ought to make a full blown hunt mode out of this with several maps, objectives, and factions in rotation. Plenty of opportunities for new maps and playable groups.

Personally I loathe ""Night on Endor"" like I do most ground modes, at this point I'm just accepting I'm probably never going to get those two challenges done. That doesn't mean we should be losing game modes as temporary. If it's added it ought to stay period. Even if I hate it with a passion someone out there really likes it and it's already there now.

"I might get downvoted for this opinion, but hear me out:  In some games, reoccuring or ""on again/off again"" events actually work to do many things such as prevent staleness, create anticipation, and basically add variety.   I play a few other games that have special events that last for a week to 10 days or so then get turned off. There's about 6 of these special event modes. Every month there's two events.   Imagine Ewok hunt always being available. Eventually, it would get stale and the mode would be more or less abandoned. Now imagine that eventually we have an Ewok Hunt, Wampa Hunt, Rancor survival, and several other specialty modes that run for a week or two then turn off then in another week or two we get a fresh mode again. this rotation would always have something new and refreshing for us to try.   I hope the devs consider this option. I'd hate for Ewok Hunt to get boring after awhile and then abandoned when it's really a cool mode..

Imagine GA with ewoks dropping nets from above and then troopers coming along and killing them or swinging a log down to knock out a row of troopers.  There is literally no purpose to the game as is and I don't see myself playing it again unless it were with a group of friends in the same room.  I do like the total darkness with flashlights.

"I shared this idea on another post.  You and a ragtag group of B1 battle droids are awaiting extraction after wiping out a Gungan colony. To get to the extraction zone, you have to trek through a Nubian swamp (complete with dilapidated CIS vehicles) in the dark. Lots of waist-deep water to navigate (a dianoga would be a nice touch, or even a habogad that would swallow a battle droid then spit it out like R2) as well as mud pits, trees, and spooky swamp sounds. Kind of a mix of Dagobah and the swamps of Naboo.  Then you hear the familiar battle cry of the Gungan, the species you just slaughtered, come out of nowhere. A few glowing boomas appear out of nowhere, heading your way.  It would be great if a swimming mechanic could be introduced, letting the Gungans quickly and silently zip through the water unseen.

" I agree that Ewok is awesome and should be added permanently.  But I think we need to keep in mind itâs not as simple as just adding a different group of natives and saying itâs done. There is a certain aesthetic and feel that Ewok Hunt has that also makes it really fun. We canât just copy and paste this into other factions (Gungans vs Droids or Jawas vs Raiders)and expect it to just work. I think if they do expand upon this game mode each âmapâ would need to have it own feel. Jawas vs Raider could maybe be a little more chaotic and less jump scare, Order 66 would perhaps be more like Ewok Hunt and darker and scarier. I love the game mode.

"I think that people who are questioning it (myself included) have valid points that are just not being looked at because other people are okay with the cosmetics costing a ton in other games therefore they are okay with it costing a ton in this game.   I have, but rarely play, R6 Siege primarily because it takes forever to unlock operators much less cosmetics. I donât play any other games with this type of mechanic but when I compare it to games that have season passes and things like that I really have a tough time justifying the money/time it takes to get a single âepicâ skin, much less whatever these legendary skins will be.   Honestly, Iâd take a season pass again over this system. The $50 I spent on the EABF season pass was the most satisfying DLC purchase Iâve ever made! New modes, heroes, star cards, AND SKINS for $50. $50 in this new system gets you 5 epic skins, which is small beans comparatively speaking.   And I donât know if everyone is a tad delusional because the update is fun but playing the game for these epic skins (and even rare to some degree) IS grindy. Itâs not as grindy as that Yeong guyâs video makes it out to be (he doesnât calculate level up bonuses, daily logins, milestones, or Ewok Huntâs super good credit rate) but it still takes a substantial amount of time to gather enough credits to get alien skins that are only used for one class of one faction or some of the hero skins.   Donây get me wrong, I like having goals to play towards, but I just think the pricing is a little high. This is the adjustment that would leave me satisfied with both my play time and my dollar spent:  Common: 5,000, 150 crystals ($1.50)  Rare: 10,000, 250 crystals ($2.50)  Epic: 20,000, 500 crystals ($5)  Legendary (soon to come): 40,000, 1,000 crystals ($10)  I donât feel this change is âtoo harshâ towards EA or âtoo easyâ for players to complete.

"I've not watched the videos etc. referenced above, but I think that given how bad the launch of this game was, it is just blacklisted now and therefore fair game for people to aim their vitriol towards certain practices.  Are the skins, so far, mind-blowingly awesome? Nah, they're okay. But then, you can earn them fairly easily with gameplay. It's a hell of a grind, but it is easily achieveable.   The new progression system is grindy but it's so much better than what we have experienced previously that it's not even funny. Overall, this game is heading in all the right directions, just a shame it's taken this long to get there instead of being great at launch.",42,DNC88,dxmdc1o,2018-04-19 12:17:04,12,1
"If you average 12,000 credits in 3 hours of play, I think this number is above the average for most peopleâ¦ (60,000 credits took me about 40 hours) and as you run through the milestones your average goes down a lotâ¦ but lets say that you are better then the averageâ¦  This would mean that if you continued to do this, for a standard full-time 40 hour work week, you would earn 160,000 credits which would be equal to 4 elite skins  (these a 40,000 credits each) or $40.00 dollars cash, that is, if you buy the best crystal value will cost more if you donât...   So E.A. and Dice, in their in-game currency is giving you, as a player the equivalent of a salary of $1 dollar per hour for your time playedâ¦ this means that it is impossible under normal game play to unlock everything and forces you the player to pay more money then a season pass or a full price $60.00 dollar retail game or for that matter even more then both combined (and this is not taking into account the original purchase price of the game) if you want to access all of the games content.  How is that right? This effectively makes the game cost more then any other star wars titleâ¦ and keep in mind, we still donât have other character or clone skins which will cost us how much more play time or money?   If you do the math, they are price gougingâ¦ to the extreme.  It is fair to say that the changes made donât effect competitive gameplay against each other anymore (more true with those playing others who are also newer to the game as they start at the same playing field) but I think it is fair and reasonable to say that this does affect everyone (or potentially affectsâ¦ as some like not being able to get everything in their gameâ¦) personal enjoyment of your individual playtime experience.   So back to the mathâ¦  A) 225,000 credits total to unlock all the ânewâ (note some are from the last version of the game) added hero skinsâ¦ these total 8 but there are 5 more from challenges or from the deluxe/ pre-order; these are additional if you have not unlocked them.  B) 480,000 credits to unlock all of the newly added class alternate heads (again, many are from the previous game)... these total 39 but you re-buy some, if you want to use them in another era (also limited to a specific class).  C)No clone or empire skins included and not including future heroes, classes or vehiclesâ¦ which they have stated you will have to unlock or pay for...  D)Not including the 5 heroes skins mentioned in A, you would need to spend an additional $176.25 (again if buying the top value crystal pack) to unlock everything recently added or play the game for more then 176 hours based on the above average game play listed above (about 4k per hour)â¦ or in my case based my average (listed above) more then 400. Most people will play for maybe 5 hours in a week if you account for having to do other daily thingsâ¦ soâ¦  Just pointing this out, and asking for a more reasoned approachâ¦ asking someone to play such large amounts of time (something most people do not have) or pay a premium is not reasonable.

Getting her first unlocked weapon took hours of playing blast cause she gets like 0-2 kills per round. I understand making mods unlockable but the fact that you need to get 400 sniper kills just to unlock one shot headshot kills with the NT weapon is pretty ridiculous and is a major reason why one would easily choose playing Widowmaker in Overwatch over a Specialist in BF2.

The support characters like Yoda or Finn might take a few games to level, but even that is a breeze.

"I finally saw an example where it actually worked. On Starkiller base on the Fuel Objective. As the Resistance, we held the objective and pop in and out of the shield to shoot anyone coming close, while protecting us against sniper fire. It worked because there were 4 of us actually defending it and the Shield was like an aid. It's pointless if you drop it and leave the objective defenseless. It also helped that it's a large enough platform that we had space outside the shield but still on the platform to go in and out.  Usually it doesn't work out so well.

Exactly.  I main officer class and shield placement strategy should be taught in school as far as Iâm concerned.  So many âwhy he fuck did you put that right there?â moments.      Pro Tip:  Place the shield on your teams side of the objective with the edge of your shield a couple feet off of the actual the objective.

"EDIT: Just saw that you said ""defend"" in title and that my entire comment is not relevant. I will keep it up as a general comment on shields/officers though, as I see them misused for attackers as well.  _____________  The key is to not place it around the objective but in choke points where your team is having trouble breaking through.  For instance, in Endor during phase I, the middle objective (underground bunker).  As the Rebels (or Empire...can't remember) it's generally tough getting down the stairs on the left. So as an Officer I will drop down and place a shield at the bottom.  Every time I have done this my team pushes up and moves the choke point from the top of those stairs to the bottom. From there, if I make it up to the objective I will drop a shield for myself or someone else.  You just have to be selective with it and think twice about how it helps your team.  Another good one is Crait phase 2 as the FO. Any objective that requires you to be in a certain area for the counter to go up is usually a good spot for the shield.  As an Officer main, I'm switching between turret and shield multiples times per map, depending on the objective.",44,InfiniteCenturyGames,dxmufiy,2018-04-19 17:00:46,17,0

"One of my favorites actually comes from an earlier version of the game. It's the Kamino journal but it had different narration. This was because there was originally a Space Kamino mission that would take place before the Kamino mission. When they scrapped Space Kamino, they transferred the dialogue from that journal over to the regular Kamino one and added a small bit about Boba Fett to the end.  [Here's the original version:](https://youtu.be/U0KIgasl-LU?t=5)  ""To this day, I can't understand what motivated our creators to rise up against us. Had they gone mad? Had we failed them in some way? In the end, it really didn't matter. The Kaminoans had to be stopped and their army of treacherous gene cousins destroyed. The first few kills were the hardest. Afterall, it's hard not to get a little spooked when the enemy screams with your voice. We shook it off and did our job. Most of the troopers never knew about Kamino. Like a lot of things in the Empire, it never really happened.""",74,TGKDR,dxm97vj,2018-04-19 10:12:22,10,1

"I agree.  Actually the campaign of BF2 seems to me to have been quite the blueprint for some of the best The Clone Wars arcs / episodes.  I loved that the campaign was just about a random dude of the 501st through who we see the events unfold.  Without going into too much controversy, this is exactly what I want about a new Battlefront game.

He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did.

I bought Hooded Yoda because he looks funny.  And a few alien troopers.   Iâm holding out for the next round that will hopefully be better. ,99,skacat,dxnn842,2018-04-20 00:32:58,00,1

How about a skin for Finn with his First Order armour with the bloody handprint on the helmet? Or a Leia skin while she's disguised as the bounty hunter from Episode 6. ,99,Jungle_Evil,dxno6r1,2018-04-20 00:49:39,00,1

"It is.  This sub is *always* gonna be a shit-show but this update shut them up REAL quick.  I was nervous that the skins would be really expensive and that would start another conniption fit, but I've only seen a few complaints. I'm actually *quite* pleased with the prices of skins so far.
